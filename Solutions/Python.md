**Problem**  
Read two integers from STDIN and print three lines where:  
1. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.  
2. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).  
3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.  

**Solution**
```python
a=int(raw_input())
b=int(raw_input())

print a+b
print a-b
print a*b
```  
####Hello World!  
*Score: 5*  
**Problem**  
The must first program in any language.  
**Solution**  
```python  
#write your code in next line. 
stringy = "Hello World!"
print stringy
```  
####Integers come in all sizes  
*Score: 10*  
**Problem**  
Read four numbers, *a*, *b*, *c*, and *d*, and print the result of *a<sup>b<\sup>+c<sup>d<\sup>*.  
**Solution**  
```python
a=int(raw_input())
b=int(raw_input())
c=int(raw_input())
d=int(raw_input())

print pow(a,b)+pow(c,d)
```  
####Loops  
*Score: 10*  
**Problem**  
Read an integer *N*. For all non-negative integers *i<N*, print *i<sup>2<\sup>*.  
**Solution**  
```python  
a= int(raw_input())

for i in range(a):
 print pow(i,2)
```  
####Mod DivMod  
*Score: 10*  
**Problem**  
Read in two integers, *a* and *b*, and print three lines.  
The first line is the integer division *a//b* (Remember to import division from __future__).  
The second line is the result of the modulo operator: *a%b*.  
The third line prints the divmod of *a* and *b*.  
**Solution**  
```python  
from __future__ import division

a= int(raw_input())
b=int(raw_input())

print a//b
print a%b
print divmod(a,b)
```  

####Power - Mod Power  
*Score: 10*  
**Problem**  
You are given three integers: *a*, *b*, and *m*, respectively. Print two lines.  
The first line should print the result of *pow(a,b)*. The second line should print the result of *pow(a,b,m)*.  
**Solution**  
```python  
a=int(raw_input())
b=int(raw_input())
m=int(raw_input())

print pow(a,b)
print pow(a,b,m)
```  
####Python Division  
*Score: 10*  
**Problem**  
Read two integers and print two lines. The first line should contain integer division, *a//b*. The second line should contain float division, *a/b*.  

You don't need to perform any rounding or formatting operations.  
**Solution**  
```python
from __future__ import division

a = int(raw_input())
b = int(raw_input())

print a//b
print a/b
```  
####Raw Input  
*Score: 10*  
**Problem**  
Read a string from the console and print it.  
**Solution**  
```python  
s = raw_input()
print s 
```
