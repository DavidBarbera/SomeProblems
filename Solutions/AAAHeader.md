#Hackerrank

###About Hackerrank  

Hackerrank is a new web portal with all sort of challenges and competitions.There is a score system where you get points for challenges solved and a world ranking to compare with other users. You can enter competitions and win prizes, and on top of that you can make yourself visible to possible employers looking to hire someone with programming skills.

The range of problems is diverse and is up to you what you want to do. There is no particular order to start but problems with low score are usually easier although it is not always the case. You can offer your solution in virtually any programming language except if the challenge is about a particular language.

###Some of the problems attempted  

I attempted a few problems in Hackerrank for the last weeks and this report is what I have been able to solve so far. I started with very easy challenges to understand how Hackerrank works, and there it is one of the first challenges: getting the input to test your code. Getting the data is a bit unusual but you get used to sort that out eventually.

Mainly, I used C++ and Python 2 to solve my challenges. If the challenges were about the programming language itself I consulted sites like: *www.python.org* or *en.cppreference.com*. Otherwise, I had to check online the theory behind the problem or try and try until I found the correct solution. This is the case of challenges in the Mathematics domain where successfull code beating all the test cases always depends on a particular mathematical fact. You may be able to code it right but without certain technical knowledge your code may run out of time trying to solve particular tests cases design to test you really crack the problem.

I found useful to use Python 2 in all the challenges not specifically related to C++, as it can be very fast to code with.

###Benefits  

The benefits of this challenge-based approach to learn programming are clear: in my case as my background is not computer science, I found my level shooting up quite soon. It allowed me to progress to my pace while dealing with my own discipline. After just a week I was good enough in Python to design this very report system to compile my solutions and count the total score.
