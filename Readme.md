#### 01 Pangrams
*Score: 30*

**Problem**  
Roy wanted to increase his typing speed for programming contests. So, his friend advised him to type the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" repeatedly, because it is a pangram. (Pangrams are sentences constructed by using every letter of the alphabet at least once.)

After typing the sentence several times, Roy became bored with it. So he started to look for other pangrams.

Given a sentence *s*, tell Roy if it is a pangram or not.

**Sample Input 1**  
We promptly judged antique ivory buckles for the next prize  

**Sample Input 2**  
We promptly judged antique ivory buckles for the prize  

**Sample Output 1**  
pangram  

**Sample Output 2**
not pangram  

**Solution:**  
```python
#!/bin/python
l=str(raw_input())

s=set(list(l.lower()))
s.discard(' ')

if len(s) == 26:
    print "pangram"
else:
    print "not pangram"

####Operator Overloading
*Score: 25*

**Problem**  
You are given a main() function which takes a set of inputs to create two matrices and prints the result of their addition. You need to write the class Matrix which has a member a of type vector\<vector\<int\> \>. You also need to write a member function to overload the operator +. The function's job will be to add two objects of Matrix type and return the resultant Matrix.  

**Sample Input**  
1 	*(#Test cases)*  
2 2 	*(NxM, dimension of the two matrices to add)*  
2 2 2 2 *(one matrix)*	
1 2 3 4 *(the other matrix)* 

**Sample Output**  
3 4  
5 6  

**Solution:**  
```C++
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

//-----------------------------------------------------------

class Matrix {
    public:

    //Matrix();
    Matrix operator+(const Matrix& right){
        Matrix sum = *this;
        int n = right.a.size();
        int m = right.a[0].size();

            for( int j = 0; j<m; j++){
                sum.a[i][j]=a[i][j]+right.a[i][j];
            }

####Variable Sized Arrays
*Score: 30*  

**Problem**  
You are given *N* integer sequences and *Q* queries. Each query is in the following format: "*a* *b*" where *a* denotes the index of the sequence, and *b* denotes the index of the element in that sequence. Your task is to find the value of the element described in each query.  

**Sample Input**  
2 2 *(N Q)*  
3 1 5 4 *(N sequences: size followed by elements)*  
5 1 2 8 9 3  
0 1 *(Q queries)*  
1 3  

**Sample Output**  
5  
9  

**Solution**  
```C++
int main(){
    int s;
    
    unsigned int N=0,Q=0,slength=0,a=0,b=1;
    cin >> N >> Q;
    unsigned int** seq = new unsigned int*[N];
    unsigned int** query = new unsigned int*[Q];
       
    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;
    for( i=0; i<N;i++){
        cin >> slength;
        seq[i]= new unsigned int[slength];
        for(j = 0; j<slength; j++){
            cin >> seq[i][j];
          }
      }
    for( i=0; i<Q;i++){
       query[i] = new unsigned int[2];
        cin >> query[i][a] >> query[i][b];
      }
    for( i=0; i<Q;i++) {
        a = query[i][0];
        b = query[i][1];
        cout << seq[a][b];
        cout << endl;
    }
  

    //free dynamic space in the heap
   for(i = 0; i<N;i++) {
           delete [] seq[i];
     }
    delete [] seq;
    for( i=0; i<Q;i++){
        delete [] query[i];
    }
    delete [] query;
      
	return 0;

**Problem:**  
Watson asks Sherlock: 
Given a string *S* of *N* 0's and *M* 1's, how many unique permutations of this string start with 1?  

Help Sherlock by printing the answer modulo (10<sup>9</sup>+7).  

**Sample Input:**
2  *(number of cases)*

mod = 10**9 + 7

for i in xrange(tests):
    n,m = raw_input().strip().split(' ')
    n,m = [int(n),int(m)]
    result = (math.factorial(n+m-1)/(math.factorial(n)*math.factorial(m-1)) ) % mod
    print result
